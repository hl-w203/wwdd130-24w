<p>I am from Kuna, Idaho, which I am going into digital marketing. I really enjoy analyzing the way that the human mind sees things and how it notices patterns and textures in stores and online. </p>
    <p>I also really enjoy boogie boarding at Horseshoe bend and reading books. My favorite author is Mitch Albom, who wrote Tuesdays with Morrie. My favorite scripture is Romans 8:31 which says "If God be for us, who can be against us?". I shared this scripture with my FSY kids almost every week because it means so much to me.</p>
